**RECSYS - A Product Recommendation System for Boycott Alternatives** 

RECSYS—a recommendation system designed to identify boycotted products and suggest ethical alternatives using machine learning , natural language processing and computer vision. Below is an overview of the system architecture and how it works.

### Project Overview
RECSYS is a web-based application that helps users identify whether a product is boycotted and suggests non-boycotted alternatives. It combines a Flask backend, a MySQL database, and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system leverages machine learning for product detection (via YOLO) and embeddings (via Sentence Transformers) to recommend alternatives based on similarity.

### How It Works

#### 1️⃣ Database Setup and Initialization (`setup.py`)
- **Purpose**: Sets up the MySQL database and populates it with product data.
- **Process**:
  - Drops and recreates tables: `products`, `product_embeddings`, `product_clusters`, and `similarities`.
  - Loads product data from `products.csv` (located in `data/`) using pandas.
  - Inserts product details (name, description, category, is_boycotted, country, brand) into the `products` table.
  - Implements constraints to ensure `boycott_id` references boycotted products and `alt_id` references non-boycotted ones in the `similarities` table.
- **Key File**: `setup.py`

---

#### 2️⃣ Product Embedding and Clustering (`embed.py`)
- **Purpose**: Generates embeddings for products and clusters them for better matching.
- **Process**:
  - Connects to the MySQL database and clears previous embeddings/clusters.
  - Fetches product data (name, description, category) from the `products` table.
  - Uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` Sentence Transformer model to generate embeddings for product text.
  - Applies K-Means clustering (up to 10 clusters) to group similar products.
  - Stores embeddings and cluster assignments in `product_embeddings` and `product_clusters` tables.
- **Key File**: `embed.py`

---

#### 3️⃣ Matching Boycotted Products with Alternatives (`match.py`)
- **Purpose**: Finds non-boycotted alternatives for boycotted products.
- **Process**:
  - Fetches products, embeddings, and clusters from the database.
  - Separates products into boycotted and non-boycotted lists.
  - Uses TF-IDF to extract keywords and enhances them with synonyms (via NLTK’s WordNet).
  - Computes similarity using a combination of cosine similarity (on embeddings) and Jaccard similarity (on keywords).
  - Prioritizes alternatives in the same cluster and category, falling back to category-only matches.
  - Stores similarity scores in the `similarities` table for later retrieval.
- **Key File**: `match.py`

---

#### 4️⃣ Backend API and Image Processing (`app.py`)
- **Purpose**: Provides API endpoints for the frontend to process images, add products, and search products.
- **Process**:
  - Uses Flask to create a REST API with CORS support.
  - **Image Processing (`/process_image`)**: Uses YOLO (`best.pt` model) to detect products in uploaded images, queries the database to check if the product is boycotted, and retrieves alternatives if applicable.
  - **Product Search (`/search_products`)**: Supports autocomplete search by querying the database for product names matching the user’s input.
  - **Add Product (`/add_product`)**: Allows adding new products to the database (future integration with Microsoft Graph for Excel updates).
  - Returns JSON responses with product details, boycott status, and alternatives.
- **Key File**: `app.py`

---

#### 5️⃣ Frontend Interface (`index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`)
- **Purpose**: Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the system.
- **Process**:
  - **UI (`index.html`)**: Offers two modes—image upload or text search—to identify products. Displays results and alternatives.
  - **Interactivity (`script.js`)**: Handles image uploads, previews, and API calls to `/process_image` and `/search_products`. Implements autocomplete for search and animates navigation with a red arrow effect.
  - **Styling (`styles.css`)**: Uses the Cairo font for Arabic text, applies RTL styling, and includes responsive design with animations for a polished look.
- **Key Files**: `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`

---

### Key Features
- **Image Recognition**: Detects products in images using YOLO.
- **NLP-Powered Matching**: Uses Sentence Transformers and TF-IDF for semantic and keyword-based similarity.
- **Clustering**: Groups similar products with K-Means for efficient matching.
- **Responsive Design**: RTL support with Arabic text and mobile-friendly layout.
- **Ethical Focus**: Helps users make informed choices by identifying boycotted products and suggesting alternatives.
